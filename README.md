# Product Sentiment Analysis using YouTube Comments
Product Sentiment Analysis Using YouTube Comments addresses the growing need to harness the wealth of public sentiment data available on online video-sharing platforms like YouTube. The primary objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis system capable of gauging public sentiment towards competing products by analyzing user comments on YouTube videos.

Competing products, such as smartphones or consumer electronics, often dominate online discussions, with users expressing their opinions, preferences, and criticisms in the comment sections of YouTube videos. By harnessing these user-generated comments, we aim to provide a systematic assessment of the public sentiment towards two products.
